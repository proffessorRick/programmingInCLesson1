// Its declaration is ONLY available in the SDL library source code,

// is hidden.
//
// SDL_Renderer is constructed by calling `SDL_CreateRenderer()'
// More info: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Renderer
//
// These structures are created globally, because when passing them
// to functions we'll either need pointer-to-pointer or a function
// pointer that is unable to take arguments. We'll perfect this 
// later on, because you should avoid globals whenever you are able...

	// SDL_Event will remain a bit of a mystery for now, since by 
	// nature, C is NOT a language that has event-enabled facilities 
	// hooked into the OS. Event handling can however be done in C, 
	// although the details are somewhat complicated. For now, let's 
	// assume this can actually work and concentrate on this thing 
	// called an `SDL_Event':

	// SDL_Event is a union (LOOK IT UP IN YOUR BOOK) that can `present' 
	// its data to the application through different `looking glasses'. 
	// Each of these looking glasses is, in reality, a struct. 
	// Some of these structs include (but are not limited to) 
	// `SDL_KeyboardEvent', `SDL_MouseWheelEvent' and `SDL_QuitEvent'.
	
	// The event sets its own type. When a type like
	// `SDL_KEYDOWN' or `SDL_KEYUP' is detected, we INFER that we're
	// looking at an `SDL_KeyboardEvent'. When a type `SDL_QUIT' is 
	// detected, we know we're dealing with an `SDL_QuitEvent'. This
	// mapping from event.type to union.member can be found here:
	// https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Event#Remarks
	// (look for the table titled `Relationships between event types 
	// and union members').
	// All event types are listed here:
	// https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_EventType
	
	// So, when we want to handle the `close button' of the window, we
	// could use SDL_QUIT 
	// See: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_EventType#SDL_QUIT
	// When we want to also close on pressing the ESC key, we'll be 
	// listening to the SDL_KEYDOWN event.

	// Events are put in a QUEUE (a buffer of sorts) in the order of
	// occurence. When you are good and ready, you can read any events
	// waiting in this queue by using the `SDL_PollEvent()'-function.
	// Calling this function places the next event from the queue in
	// the event variable (by passing it using `&event').
	// You may then proceed to read its type and determine a suitable
	// course of action based on this information.

	// In our case, we'll be reading the queue until it's empty on 
	// a fixed moment during our game loop --
	// see: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PollEvent
